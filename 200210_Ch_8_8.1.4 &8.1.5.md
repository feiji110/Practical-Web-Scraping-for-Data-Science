## 8.1.4 Proxy Servers

+  set up a **local** HTTP proxy server 
> An HTTP proxy server acts as an **intermediary** for HTTP requests as follows: a **client** (a web browser or Python program) sends off **an HTTP request**, though *now not by contacting the web server on the Internet*, but sending it to the **proxy server first** . 
Then it may modify the request 
+ the usage
1. most proxy servers include options to **inspect** HTTP requests and replies, so that they offer a solid add-on on top of your browser’s developer tools.
2. most proxy servers can be configured to enable caching, keeping the HTTP replies in their **memory** so that the end destination does not have to be contacted multiple times for subsequent(随后的) similar requests. 
3. **anonymity** 
+ Note that the destination web server will see an HTTP request coming in that originated from the HTTP proxy server, which does **not** necessarily need to run on your **local development machine.**As such，circumvent(回避) web scraping mitigation(缓解) techniques where you might be blocked in case the web server sees too many requests coming from the same machine. 指应对反网络爬取手段中的一台计算机发出多个请求被服务器阻止的情况。
+ pay for a service providing a pool of HTTP proxy servers ( e.g. https://proxymesh.com/) + + use anonymity services such as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), which is free, but primarily meant to provide anonymity, and might be less suitable for web scrapers, as Tor tends to be *relatively slow*, and many web scraping mitigations will also keep* a list of Tor “exit points” and block them*. 
+ some solid(可靠的) HTTP proxy server implementations
    - [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) 
    - [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)
## 8.1.5 Scraping in Other Programming Languages
 + Selenium-> **Java** 
 + **R** 
   - [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/)
+ JavaScript 
> the language becoming more and more viable(可行) as a **server-side scripting language** as well has also spawned(引起) a lot of powerful scraping libraries for this language as well.
